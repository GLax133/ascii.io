# About

ASCII.IO is the simplest way to record your terminal and share the recordings
with your fellow geeks.

It's a free service built with open-source technologies (check the
[source](https://github.com/sickill/ascii.io)
[code](https://github.com/sickill/ascii.io-cli)) aiming to be a "go to" place
for everyone who want to share his terminal Voodoo.

## Parts

The service consists of two parts:

* Terminal recording utility
* This site with web based player

Terminal recorder is a [Python
script](https://github.com/sickill/ascii.io-cli/blob/master/bin/asciiio)
that acts as a middleman
([pseudo-terminal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo_terminal) specifically)
between your shell and your terminal, recording all terminal activity and
uploading it to [ascii.io](http://ascii.io) site.

Web based player is a JavaScript implementation of
[VT102 ANSI terminal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT102), supporting most ANSI
control codes and sequences, all text attributes and
[256 colors](<%= asciicast_path(CFG['COLOR_CHECK_CAST_ID']) %>).
